Resume
================================

Hi!

This is a modular resume based on pluggable uniform jade partials. It uses gulp to build the project and watch for changes. A nice side-effect of this design is that a different css can be applied to same build for generation of pdf too.

Feel free to fork it over.

Todo
------------------------------

Implement pdf generation by using build html and separate specialized css file.
